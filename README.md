CSteamworks
===========

**Note:** This project is deprecated as Valve now prodives a C ABI wrapper built into steam_api.dll.

_CSteamworks_ is a C ABI Wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API. It relys heavily on automatic code generation.
The primary use case for _CSteamworks_ is to act as a buffer between a scripting language and the Steamworks C++ Interfaces.

To use _CSteamworks_ you must be a Steamworks developer.

* Download the Latest Steamworks SDK from the Steamworks Partner site.
* Copy `redistibutable_bin/` over from the Steamworks SDK into the root of this folder.
* Copy the `steam/` folder located in `public/` over from the Steamworks SDK into the root of this folder.
* Run CSteamworks.py which will generate the bindings into `wrapper/`
* Use the Makefile/Project files in `build/` to compile the dynamic libraries.
